This repository contains a Flask application for predicting diabetes based on a trained machine learning model. The machine learning model is trained using a dataset with features such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, etc. The training and visualization of the model are performed using the `practical.py` script.

### Flask App (`app.py`)
